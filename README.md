# ML Workshop Resources

This repository contains the resources for the practical exercises of a 2-day Machine Learning workshop organized by Jan Hadl. The exercises are intended to convey the essential steps for building, training, tuning, and using ML models, additionally focusing on the particularities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the exercises for day 2. 

The code uses only publicly accessible frameworks and datasets and is intended to be able to run on free Jupyter-Notebook offerings like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.google/), or similarly specced consumer-grade hardware.
